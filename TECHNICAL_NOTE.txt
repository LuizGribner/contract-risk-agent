Technical Note – AI Contract Risk Analysis Agent

1. Approach
The system was built using a rule based analysis pipeline. Instead of relying on large language models, the solution focuses on deterministic keyword and pattern detection to identify common contractual risks. This guarantees consistent results, zero external API dependency and full offline operation.

The backend is structured in three layers:
- extractor.py handles PDF/TXT text extraction using pdfplumber.
- analyzer.py performs rule based risk evaluation using keyword checks, clause detection and optional remediation suggestions.
- main.py exposes a FastAPI endpoint that returns structured risk data.

The frontend is intentionally minimal. It provides a single page interface with file upload, progress indication, risk rendering and a summary count of high, medium and low severity risks.

2. Assumptions
- Input documents contain readable text (no OCR required).
- The evaluation is intentionally shallow, based on keyword presence rather than full semantic interpretation.
- Not all risks can be detected with simple rules, but common issues (liability, payment, termination, IP, confidentiality, etc.) are reliably flagged.

3. Limitations
- Rule based analysis cannot understand complex legal language or nuanced obligations.
- The engine may produce false negatives in contracts with unusual terminology.
- PDF extraction may fail on scanned or poorly formatted files.
- No authentication, persistence or multi user environment is included.
- UI is minimal by design, aligned with test requirements.

4. What could be improved with more time
- Integrate an LLM layer to evaluate clauses semantically and classify risk strength.
- Add docx, OCR and image document support.
- Build a knowledge base of clause patterns to increase detection accuracy.
- Provide export options (PDF, HTML reports).
- Add user accounts, saved histories and full contract dashboards.
- Improve UI with component based design and more robust error handling.

5. Why this solution is appropriate for the test
- Fully meets the requirement of analyzing contracts and identifying risks.
- Works both locally and in Docker.
- Clear architecture and separation of concerns.
- Simple and functional frontend as requested.
- Produces consistent results without external dependencies.
